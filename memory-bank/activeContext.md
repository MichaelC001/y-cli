# Active Context: y-cli

## Current Focus
Initial project documentation and memory bank setup. Establishing foundational understanding of the project structure, architecture, and goals.

## Recent Changes
1. Created memory-bank directory
2. Established core documentation files:
   - projectbrief.md
   - productContext.md
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md

## Active Decisions

### Documentation Structure
- Organized memory bank with core required files
- Established clear documentation hierarchy
- Focused on comprehensive system understanding
- Maintained clear relationships between documentation components

### Project Understanding
- Analyzed project structure and components
- Identified key architectural patterns
- Documented technical stack and dependencies
- Mapped system relationships and workflows

## Current Considerations

### Documentation Completeness
- Need to complete activeContext.md
- Need to create progress.md
- Need to establish .clinerules
- Consider additional context files as needed

### System Analysis
- Further analysis of chat providers needed
- Deeper understanding of MCP implementation required
- Bot management workflow details to be explored
- CLI command structure to be documented in detail

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete remaining core documentation files
2. Create .clinerules file
3. Review and validate all documentation
4. Consider additional context files needed

### Future Tasks
1. Deep dive into chat provider implementations
2. Analyze MCP server integration patterns
3. Document bot management workflows
4. Map CLI command relationships

## Open Questions
1. Specific chat provider implementation details
2. MCP server configuration patterns
3. Bot state management approach
4. CLI command extension points

## Current Status
Setting up foundational project documentation and establishing memory bank structure. Focus on creating comprehensive understanding of system architecture and patterns.
